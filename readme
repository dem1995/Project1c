Custom shell for POSIX systems (tested with Ubuntu November 2017)
Author: David McKnight

1. Compilation and usage:
To compile the shell, use the make file via the commands "make" or "make all".

To run the shell, simply invoke the name of the .out file produced by the make instruction.
If you wish to use the shell with a batch file (i.e. instructions in a text file), call "[.out file name] [name of batch file in .out directory]"
